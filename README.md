# Move-selected-files-from-one-directory-to-another
Using the Python code we can move tons of thousands of files from one directory to another.

Using the code we can transfer files from one directory to another using the OS and shutil library.
Simply with the code what we are doing is we create similar folder name in the destination directory. Then we choose the file extension to which we want to move from one directory to another.

Kindly change the directory name according to your preference and select the filetype (eg. .pfd or .mp4) that need to be transferred.
